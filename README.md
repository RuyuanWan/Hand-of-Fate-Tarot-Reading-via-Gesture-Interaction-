This is an immersive mixed-reality webpage that translates hand gestures to create a natural tarot card drawing experience.

🖐 How to Interact
The system requires camera access to track hand landmarks. If denied, the engine automatically downgrades to mouse Mode.

OPEN PALM: Neutral state. Allows the Star Matrix to rotate freely.
PINCH (Thumb + Index): Raycast-trigger. If a card is highlighted, this "grabs" it, pulls it to the foreground, and flips it to reveal the face (Upright or Reversed).
FIST (Closed hand): Confirmation trigger. Transmutes the active card into ash.
POINT (Index finger): Precision hover. Halts matrix inertia and highlights specific cards.
